# Urho3D-Docker-Container
Docker container build script to build Urho3D engine. Container can be used later on to build Urho3D projects. 

To see sample check out https://github.com/ArnisLielturks/Urho3D-Empty-Project which uses CircleCI and this Urho3D docker container is used to build it.

Here's my public docker repository which was built this way: https://hub.docker.com/r/arnislielturks/urho3d/

```
